# Queue Management System - Action Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a CLI-based Queue Management System for organizations with high customer flow. The system will manage client tickets, employee service stations, and provide administrative reporting capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Package Structure
- `model`: Core domain entities
- `service`: Business logic and operations
- `repository`: Data persistence and retrieval
- `util`: Helper utilities
- `ui`: Command-line interface components

### Data Persistence
- JSON files will store all system data
- All historical data will be maintained
- Files will be read at startup and written at key actions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Models and Persistence
1. Implement base domain models following OOP principles
    - Establish inheritance hierarchy with User as base class
    - Implement all entity classes with proper encapsulation
    - Add proper constructors, getters/setters, and overridden methods

2. Set up data persistence layer
    - Create JSON serialization/deserialization utilities
    - Implement repository interfaces and concrete implementations
    - Establish data loading and saving mechanisms

### Phase 2: Business Logic Services
1. Implement service layer classes
    - User management for authentication and profiles
    - Ticket creation, status management, and queuing
    - Category configuration and management
    - Station assignment and state control
    - Statistics generation and reporting

2. Implement core operations
    - Ticket generation with unique alphanumeric codes
    - Ticket state transitions (waiting → in progress → completed)
    - Time tracking for wait and service durations
    - Queue management and prioritization

### Phase 3: Command-Line Interface
1. Create menu-driven interfaces
    - Main menu for role selection
    - Client interactions for ticket requests
    - Employee dashboard for ticket processing
    - Administrator console for system configuration

2. Implement user workflows
    - Client ticket request flow
    - Employee ticket processing flow
    - Administrative reporting and configuration flow

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
1. Create test scenarios
    - Generate sample data for all entity types
    - Test all user stories and use cases
    - Verify persistence across program restarts

2. Perform code review and refinement
    - Ensure proper documentation
    - Apply OOP best practices
    - Optimize performance for file operations

## Functional Components

### Client Module
- **Ticket Request**: Clients enter ID and select service category
- **Queue Status**: Clients can check current queue status
- **Ticket Cancellation**: Clients can cancel their tickets

### Employee Module
- **Authentication**: Employees login with credentials
- **Ticket Processing**: View, start, and complete tickets
- **Service Pausing**: Temporarily pause new ticket assignments
- **Daily Summary**: View personal service statistics

### Administrator Module
- **Category Management**: Configure service categories
- **Station Management**: Create and manage service stations
- **Employee Assignment**: Assign employees to stations/categories
- **Reporting**: Generate productivity and service reports

## Data Model Details

### User
- Base class with authentication functionality
- Extended by Employee and Administrator

### Client
- Basic information for ticket association
- No authentication required

### Ticket
- Unique code generation
- Timestamps for waiting and service times
- State transitions (waiting, in progress, completed, cancelled)

### Category
- Service type definitions
- Prefix codes for ticket generation
- Queue management per category

### Station
- Physical or logical service points
- Employee assignments
- Category service capabilities

### Statistics
- Aggregation of service metrics
- Waiting and processing time calculations
- Productivity measurements

## User Interface Flow

### Main Flow
1. System displays role selection (Client, Employee, Administrator)
2. Based on selection, appropriate sub-menu is displayed
3. User interacts with system through text commands
4. Exit returns to previous menu level

### Client Flow
1. Client enters ID
2. System displays available service categories
3. Client selects category and receives ticket code
4. Optional queue status check or ticket cancellation

### Employee Flow
1. Employee enters credentials
2. System displays current assigned tickets
3. Employee processes tickets sequentially
4. System records service times automatically

### Administrator Flow
1. Administrator enters credentials
2. System displays management options
3. Administrator configures system or generates reports
4. Changes are persisted immediately

## Technical Considerations

### JSON File Structure
- Each entity type has its own file
- Arrays of objects with unique identifiers
- References between objects via IDs

### Time Tracking
- Java LocalDateTime for all timestamps
- Automatic calculation of durations
- Daily reset of statistics (optional)

### Code Generation
- Alphanumeric codes based on category prefix
- Sequential numbering per category
- Reset daily or maintain continuous sequence

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Follow object-oriented principles:
    - Encapsulation of data with private fields
    - Proper inheritance hierarchies
    - Interface segregation where appropriate

2. Error handling:
    - Validate all user inputs
    - Graceful handling of file operations
    - Informative error messages

3. Documentation:
    - JavaDoc comments for all classes and methods
    - Clear naming conventions
    - Inline comments for complex logic

4. Testing:
    - Test data generation in main method
    - Verification of all user stories
    - Persistence validation

## Next Steps

1. Implement core model classes
2. Set up JSON file handler utility
3. Create repositories for data access
4. Implement service layer for business logic
5. Build command-line interface components
6. Connect all components in Main class
7. Test with sample scenarios
